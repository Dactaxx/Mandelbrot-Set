# Mandelbrot-Set
One of the most interesting programs I've written. It renders out images of the Mandelbrot set at a specific coordinate, zoom, and number of iteration. You can also change how it colors the fractal. No GUI, requires that you run it in a Java development environment and directly modify the code.
